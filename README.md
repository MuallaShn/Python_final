# Smart Home System Introduction

Ayşe is an artificial intelligence system that enables users to manage various hardware components through voice commands and web-based controls. Ayşe is designed to answer most of the users' questions thanks to its AI infrastructure and functions as a smart assistant.

This project integrates with hardware prototypes, enabling physical operations such as controlling LEDs and a TV. Furthermore, the buttons on the web interface allow users to control the LEDs and TV and connect to and turn off the computer.

## Visualization

The interface includes three different graphs to visualize vessel behavior:

- **Pc Card**: The pc button provides computer shutdown control.
- **TV Card**: The tv button is used to send a signal to the TV.
- **Lights Card**: Led buttons to provide control to turn the LEDs on and off.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages a combination of modern technologies and programming languages:

-Python: Backend programming for voice control assistant.
-Javascript: Connect to devices with dynamic URLs and change state control.
-C++: Ardunio control.
-React & Bootstrap: Structure and styling for the user interface.
-Ollama, Vosk, Sounddevice, gTTs, pygame
