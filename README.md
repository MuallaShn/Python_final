# Smart Home System Introduction

Ayşe is an artificial intelligence system that enables users to manage various hardware components through voice commands and web-based controls. Ayşe is designed to answer most of the users' questions thanks to its AI infrastructure and functions as a smart assistant.

This project integrates with hardware prototypes, enabling physical operations such as controlling LEDs and a TV. Furthermore, the buttons on the web interface allow users to control the LEDs and TV and connect to and turn off the computer.
